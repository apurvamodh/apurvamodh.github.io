        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Apurva Modh, an accomplished Network Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer with a robust background in network design, automation, and reliability. My expertise spans over seven years in designing and automating networks, where I have gained proficiency in Python, Go-lang, shell, and NetConf, along with a deep understanding of core routing technologies such as OSPF, ISIS, BGP, MPLS, RSVP, PIM, and MSDP.</p>

            <p>In my career, I have developed a strong command over data center technologies, including STP, EVPN/VxLAN, VRRP, LLDP, and MLAG, and have honed my skills in network security with experiences in IPSec, GRE, and Zero Trust Networking. My role at Juniper Networks Canada as a Technical Support Engineer involved leading support for ISP, Enterprise, and Data Center networks, focusing on EVPN/VxLAN, BGP, MPLS VPN, STP, and Zero Touch Automation, where I spearheaded automation projects and led coordination for bug fixes with the engineering team.</p>
                
            <p>During my tenure at Google, I managed high-throughput distributed systems, ensuring optimal performance and automating network functions to achieve ultra-low latency in data centers. My commitment to excellence in network engineering and site reliability has been recognized with Googleâ€™s Feats of Engineering Award and multiple Spot Bonuses.</p>
                
            <p>I hold professional certifications including JNCIP-SP, CCNP, CCNA, JNCIS-SP, and JNCIA, which underscore my technical proficiency and dedication to the field. My educational background, with a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Communication, further solidifies my foundation in the tech industry, enabling me to drive success in highly demanding and dynamic environments.</p>
